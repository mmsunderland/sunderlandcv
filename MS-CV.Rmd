# Profile
\
I am a Senior Research Fellow and Program Lead of Measurement and Methodology at the Matilda Centre for Research in Mental Health and Substance Use, the University of Sydney. I lead an internationally recognised program of research that utilises innovative statistical and psychometric methods to answer important epidemiological questions on the relationship between mental health and substance use. I am a strong believer in open science and ensuring my work is transparent and of a high ethical standard. I am passionate about building capacity in the use of innovative quantitative methods in psychiatric research and effectively disseminating and translating my work into policy and practice.

# Research 
\
I have authored \textbf{`r NROW(pubs)`} scientific journal articles, book chapters, and technical reports. A full list of publications is provided on pages \pageref{pubstart}--\pageref{pubend}. I have developed or co-developed \textbf{`r NROW(measures)`} scales or assessment tools to measure mental health and substance use disorders on pages \pageref{meastart}--\pageref{meaend}.  
\
\
My current work addresses three key themes: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{itm:first}Re-conceptualising the classification of mental health and substance use disorders.
\item \label{itm:second}Targeting inefficiencies in large-scale data collection and assessment.
\item \label{itm:third}Utilising innovative statistical procedures to generate new epidemiological evidence to inform prevention and early intervention efforts.
\end{enumerate}

# Presentations

I have personally presented \textbf{`r NROW(presos)`} conferences presentations or invited seminars/workshops (see Table below). I have also co-authored >30 international and national presentations that were delivered by other co-authors (details not provided here). 
```{r}

# Research funding
```{r grants}

```
I have successfully obtained approximately $`r sprintf("%2.1f", sumgrants/1e6)` million in external research funds as Chief Investigator or Associate Investigator. The majority of my research funds have been acquired since my previous promotion in 2016 as can be seen in the below table.

# Teaching
\
As a  research-focused academic for the past ten years my teaching experience has involved research student supervision and capacity building in statistics among research staff and students. I currently supervise six PhD students and one Doctor of Psychology student. I have successfully supervised one Phd student, five undergraduate honours students, and one summer intern student to completion. I currently lead the Statistics Portfolio and conduct Statistics drop in sessions twice a week for 45 minutes via Zoom for all staff and students. My primary approach to teaching is to form a highly collaborative relationship with my students. I feel it is important to maximise student development by prioritising independent creative thinking with strong support systems in place.
